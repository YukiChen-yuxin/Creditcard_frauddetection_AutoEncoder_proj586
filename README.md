# Creditcard_frauddetection_AutoEncoder_proj586

With the widespread use of credit card technology, credit card fraud cases have been increasing. AutoEncoders
use the method of calculating errors in reconstructed data to make reasonable judgments about the category
of data and return accurate classification answers. Compared to supervised algorithms, AutoEncoders can
better handle imbalanced and unlabeled data. In this study, a deep AutoEncoder model is used for credit card
fraud detection, which includes a multi-layer network of encoders and decoders and implements the method
of reconstructing data to find the error threshold and achieve classification of fraud cases. The final model has
a recognition accuracy of 91%. The study shows that based on deep AutoEncoders, this project can achieve
relatively accurate credit card fraud anomaly detection.
